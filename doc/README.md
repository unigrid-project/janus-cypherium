UNIGRID Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[UNIGRID Core](http://unigrid.org) is the original UNIGRID client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of UNIGRID transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.
